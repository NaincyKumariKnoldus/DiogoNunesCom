                    <h3 name="what" id="what">What it is</h3>
                    <p>PISTAE stands for <a href="htpp://pistae.ist.utl.pt/"><em>Portal de Apoio e entreajuda dos Estudantes do IST</em></a> (Portal for Support and mutual help of the IST's Students). It was created to centralize information and resources that can help students increase their academic success, by publishing and referencing study materials of the IST's disciplines. It also contains summaries of IST's degrees and subjects written by older students so the younger ones may choose and prepare themselfs knowing what is expecting them. Lastly the PISTAE's volunteers write articles about soft-skills development (like public speaking, study techniques, motivation, etc.) and their academic experiences.</p>
                    <p>PISTAE is maintained voluntarily <em>from students to students</em>. The IST's student volunteers collect information from various sources and condense them into articles that are available online for everyone. The benefits are mutual: for the volunteer student, who learns while searching, summing and writing content, and for the student that accesses a single portal where his or her questions are easily answered.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3 name="why" id="why">Why I've done it</h3>
                    <p>I always had this will to assist and guide younger students because I empathize with them. I've been in their situation and I know how good it is to have someone to ask for advice. This way newcomers can avoid repeating the same mistakes others made and can enjoy a richer and more efficient academic experience.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3 name="lessons" id="lessons">Lessons learned</h3>
                    <p>The website was made using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, that was new to me by the time. I also learned how to use <a href="http://inkscape.org">InkScape</a> to make the PISTAE's logo, which started as a simple drawing during a (boring) lesson. Since day one I got the institutional support through <a href="http://nape.ist.utl.pt">Students Helpdesk (NAPE)</a>. Later I met with representatives of each IST-Taguspark's degrees and received their support as well. In the end the effort paid off because the feedback I received from freshmans was very positive. The college (and its students) gained a repository of relevant and sincere information that can be extended to IST-Alameda's degrees and master's degree or even as an example for other colleges.</p>
