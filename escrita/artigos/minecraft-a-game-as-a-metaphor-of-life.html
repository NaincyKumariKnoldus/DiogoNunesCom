Yesterday, I was missing playing Minecraft.</p>                    <p>                        <a href="img/minecraft-timer.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="Minecraft's demo countdown"><img src="img/minecraft-timer.png" class="img-polaroid img-left" width="180" height="auto" alt="Minecraft's demo countdown"></a>                        The last time I played it (almost 6 months ago) <strong>I made a promise not to play it ever again</strong>, mainly because without self-control it consumes hours and hours of your time. The game has no specific objective and is based on adventure, so you always have something to do or try.                    </p>                    <p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mhNbX6ET9Y">I heard one of the songs</a> that compose the game's soundtrack and I felt an urge to play the game again - by the way, you should really <a href="http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha">check the whole album</a> because most of the songs are adorable.</p>                    <p>I decided to play the free demo, available at the official website - yes, you can play it for free right from the browser! The demo is like the full game <em>but</em> with limited playing time (100 minutes). After playing it for almost an hour I had an epiphany: <strong>Minecraft's <u>demo</u> is a metaphor of life itself.</strong> Only now, due to the thoughts and feelings that my breakdown brought, I could notice it.</p>                    <p>                        <a href="img/minecraft-1.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="I'm alive, what now?"><img src="img/minecraft-1.png" class="img-polaroid img-right" width="180" height="auto" alt="I'm alive, what now?" ></a>                        When you start the game you are told that you have a limited time to play it. You have no rules, no purpose, no friends; it's just you and a giant world. You start exploring and you notice plants, animals, water, clouds and a big luminous sun. You also notice that on the upper right corner there's a <strong>countdown</strong>; that is <strong>the time you have left on that world</strong>. That's the only rule, <em>when the time runs out you die</em>. No matter where you are, what you're doing, what you have accomplished, what you built... it ends.                    </p>                    <p>Wow.</p>                    <p>Knowing that changes your whole perspective about the world. What's your purpose? <strong>How are you going to spend your time?</strong> Of course in the full game you aren't time limited, therefore people build gigantic constructions using complex machinery and others collect and craft all possible kinds of objects. They do all this to show it off. <strong>Why would you build stuff and collect stuff if you know it will all be gone after the clock stops?</strong> Is this adventure about you or the others? <strong>I decided to explore</strong> the world. It seems to me the most reasonable and fulfilling choice. I may have limited time but I'll <strong>enjoy</strong> every minute, I'll <strong>feel</strong> the adrenaline of exploring, I'll <strong>discover</strong> the diversity this world, <strong>I'll live!</strong></p>                    <p class="text-center">                        <a href="img/minecraft-3.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="My first sunset"><img src="img/minecraft-3.png" class="img-polaroid img-center-inline" width="200" height="auto" alt="My first sunset" ></a>                        <a href="img/minecraft-2.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="My modest house (it has no windows, but at least has some red roses in the front)"><img src="img/minecraft-2.png" class="img-polaroid img-center-inline" width="200" height="auto" alt="My modest house (it has no windows, but at least has some red roses in the front)" ></a>                        <a href="img/minecraft-5.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="A creeper stalking me"><img src="img/minecraft-5.png" class="img-polaroid img-center-inline" width="200" height="auto" alt="A creeper stalking me" ></a>                    </p>                    <p>I observed my first sunset and it's beautiful. I made myself a wooden sword, but that won't help much in a fight, thus I built a simple house: four wooden walls, a door, no floor, no roof, no bed. I don't need more, I just needed shelter from the zombies, the spiders and the creepers outside. Yes, <strong>there are <em>things</em> outside that want to hurt you and <em>stop your clock immediately</em></strong>. Zombies and spiders make a lot of noise when following you, so you have plenty of time to prepare yourself. Creepers on the other hand are <em>silent and deadly</em>. They crawl behind you and, literally, explode. The last thing you hear is the sound of an explosive's burning fuse. <strong>Can you notice the metaphor?</strong> Bonus tip: accidents, diseases,...</p>                    <p>                        <a href="img/minecraft-6.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="A cave at the base of a mountain"><img src="img/minecraft-6.png" class="img-polaroid img-left" width="180" height="auto" alt="A cave at the base of a mountain" ></a>                        <a href="img/minecraft-7.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="A sunrise at the peak of the same mountain"><img src="img/minecraft-7.png" class="img-polaroid img-right" width="180" height="auto" alt="A sunrise at the peak of the same mountain" ></a>                        I found a cave in a mountain. Obviously <strong>I entered it since I was looking for adventure and mistery</strong>. It was pitch dark. I mined <em>just enough</em> coal and crafted <em>just enough</em> torches to lighten my way. I found more tunnels but sometimes I needed to mine my way through the mountain. I saw bats and fought spiders and skeletons. I reached a dead end, but then I heard sheeps. That's right sheeps, under the mountain!! I started <a href="http://youtu.be/fR7EAdPUqvQ">diggin' a hole</a>, but this time upwards! After mining a few blocks of rock, I found dirt and finally grass. I had made it to the top of the mountain. And by my side, a purple sheep. Thank you for your guiding "baaaahs", purple sheep.</p>                    <p>Later on, the game remembered me: <strong>"This is your last day!"</strong> What an intriguing thing to hear. Wouldn't it be nice to know your countdown? Wouldn't it be nice to have someone warn you, <em>"good morning, just to let you know that this is your last day"</em>? I really don't know. But now that my time is running out, I'm thankful that I didn't waste it building a <a href="http://youtu.be/s0jsVJZI8YI?t=1m8s">giant red dragon</a> or a <a href="http://youtu.be/CjuN8sEfBxc?t=55s">replica of Lord of the Rings' Minas Tirith</a>, block by block.</p>                    <p><a href="img/minecraft-9.png" rel="lightbox-group" title="This is your last day!"><img src="img/minecraft-9.png" class="img-polaroid img-center" width="400" height="auto" alt="This is your last day!" ></a></p>                    <p><strong>And the time ran out.</strong> It wasn't a game over; I could not win and I certainly did not loose, it just ended and I couldn't insert more coins. That world, my avatar, my modest house, my stuff, were all gone. And now I was in another world, another person, another house, other stuff. Will there be another world after this? I don't know but I hope so. What time I have left in this world? I really don't know, but I hope <strong><a href="http://youtu.be/2cmAuKS1ZRE">it's adventure time!</a></strong></p>                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>                    <p>Minecraft is <em>just</em> a game, and I played just a <em>demo</em> of it. It's amazing how <a href="http://youtu.be/t0eqSgkDuW0" title="The creation and evolution of Minecraft">a modest (indie) game</a> can model so closely life itself. The game really is just <strong>blocks</strong> with different aspects interacting with each other. Yet again, life is just <strong>atoms</strong> and energy interactions. See? That's the beauty: I described a game but I could have described a life with the exact same text.</p>                    <p>Focus on living experiences and not on collecting stuff. Stuff is left behind but experiences are part of you. Remember, <strong><em>you can't see it but the countdown is ticking...</em> :)</strong></p>                    <br/>                    <p align="center"><a href="/escrita/"><button class="btn btn-mini"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-left"></i> Return to "Writing"</button></a></p>                </div>            </div>            <?php echo $footer; ?>        </div>        <?php echo $JS_scripts; ?>        <script src="/assets/plugin_slimbox/js/slimbox2.js"></script>    </body></html>
